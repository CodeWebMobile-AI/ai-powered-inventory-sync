# ai-powered-inventory-sync

## 1. Project Title and Description

**ai-powered-inventory-sync** is a real-time inventory management solution designed to help small businesses streamline their inventory tracking across multiple sales channels. It synchronizes inventory data across online stores (Shopify, WooCommerce, Etsy, Amazon), physical locations, and marketplaces. The platform leverages AI-driven forecasting and alerts to optimize stock levels, minimize stockouts, and improve overall inventory efficiency.

## 2. Problem Statement

Small businesses frequently struggle with the complexities of real-time inventory tracking when operating across multiple sales channels. This lack of accurate, up-to-date inventory data often leads to:

*   **Stockouts:** Losing potential sales due to items being unavailable.
*   **Overselling:** Accepting orders for products that are out of stock, damaging customer relationships.
*   **Inaccurate Financial Reports:** Difficulty in accurately assessing inventory value and cost of goods sold.
*   **Manual Reconciliation:** Time wasted manually reconciling inventory across platforms, diverting resources from core business activities.

## 3. Target Audience and Value Proposition

**Target Audience:** This platform is tailored for small business owners in retail, e-commerce, and wholesale with revenues ranging from $50,000 to $500,000. These businesses often lack the resources or expertise to implement complex enterprise-level inventory management systems.

**Value Proposition:**

*   **Automated Inventory Synchronization:** Eliminates manual reconciliation, saving time and reducing errors.
*   **Real-time Visibility:** Provides an accurate, up-to-the-minute view of inventory levels across all channels.
*   **AI-Driven Forecasting:** Predicts future demand, enabling proactive inventory management.
*   **Low Stock Alerts:** Prevents stockouts and lost sales with timely notifications.
*   **Improved Financial Accuracy:** Ensures accurate inventory valuation and cost of goods sold for better financial reporting.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use dashboards provide actionable insights for business owners.

## 4. Features

The initial feature set includes:

*   **Automatic inventory synchronization across Shopify and WooCommerce:**  Seamlessly sync inventory data between these popular e-commerce platforms and our system.
*   **Low stock alert notifications (email, SMS) based on AI-driven thresholds:** Receive timely notifications when stock levels fall below dynamically calculated thresholds, helping to prevent stockouts.
*   **Basic demand forecasting based on historical sales data:** Gain insights into future demand with our initial demand forecasting capabilities.
*   **Inventory tracking for a single physical location:** Manage inventory levels for a physical store or warehouse.
*   **Reporting dashboard with key inventory metrics (stock levels, turnover rate):**  Track key performance indicators (KPIs) related to your inventory for informed decision-making.

## 5. Tech Stack

*   **Backend (API):** Laravel (PHP Framework)
*   **Frontend:** React (JavaScript Library) with TypeScript, Inertia.js
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (Relational Database)

### AI Forecasting Methodology

**Description of the Algorithms Used for Demand Forecasting:**

The initial demand forecasting implementation will use a combination of:

*   **Moving Average:** Calculates the average demand over a specified period.
*   **Exponential Smoothing:**  Assigns exponentially decreasing weights to historical data.

Future iterations will leverage more advanced machine learning algorithms, potentially including:

*   **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average):** A statistical model for time series forecasting.
*   **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):**  A type of neural network that is well-suited for time series data.
*   **Prophet (Facebook):**  A procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model.

The AI model will be trained using historical sales data and will be continuously updated as new data becomes available.  The accuracy of the forecasts will be monitored and used to improve the performance of the model.
